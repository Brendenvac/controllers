# To use Cutebot:   
On the NRS, click on "EMBODIMENT". Then, you will see "PRIMARY: Cutebot" with a switch next 
to it. Click that switch, and a pop-up window full of device options will appear. Select the one 
labeled `uBit`. Each micro:bit has its own unique name. For example, mine is `uBit[zovep]`. Yours will have its own name too.

**MAC only**: You will see this menu pop up. Due to Apple's security measures, it is required to ask for user permission, so you can simply press 'connect'. See here for an example:

You should now see the number `2` displayed on the micro:bit's LCD. This indicates a successful connection.


# Important information
Microbit requires bluetooth connectivity which is only supported by Chrome browser at this time.
